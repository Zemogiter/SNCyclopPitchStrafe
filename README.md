Subnautica Mod allow Cyclop Pitch &amp; Strafe

Inspired by maxp0wer789's mod. Thank you.

The Mod allows the Cyclop to move laterally and perform a turn according to the Right axis. When starting the turn, the cyclop's stabilizer is deactivated and a key has been enabled to reactivate it.

Caution: If a very large incline is applied in uphill mode and exiting riding mode, the player will fall against the bulkhead and will not be able to ride the cyclop again or exit it.
